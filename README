git_tools - scripts for managing many repos.

I have a folder (~/Documents/work) that contains all of the work I'm doing. This folder contains a series of subfolders, each of which is an individual git repo. I tried using submodules, but that's dumb. I need some scripts that allow me to manage a folder that's full of git repos.

Requirements
------------
* One command, `cloneall` should clone all of the repos contained in a specified directory. For example, I keep bare git repos in /media/DERPLETON/srv. This command should step through each repo in that directory and clone it into the directory in which the command is executed.
* If `cloneall` is executed in a folder already containing git repos, it looks at the folder with the remotes and clones what is missing.
* I need a command that I can execute in the parent directory that steps through all the subdirectory repos and checks if they have changes that haven't been committed.
* That command should also tell me if those changes have been pushed to the remote.
* The command should give me an option to make the easy pushes (fast-forward).
* I need a command that checks the remotes of all the repos in the folder in which the command is executed to see if there are changes that need to be pulled in.
* That command will also fetch (NOT pull) the changes from the remotes.
* I want an option with the command to merge any changes fetched from the remotes that can be fast-forwarded.
* This command will deal with branches elegantly.
